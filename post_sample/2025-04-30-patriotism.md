Today marks 50 years since the North and South of Vietnam were reunited. After enduring a series of wars against France, Japan, the United States, and China, Vietnam achieved full independence and national unity on April 30, 1975, ending more than a hundred years of foreign domination and division. This important day means a lot to the Vietnamese people and reminds us not only of history, but also of the many personal stories that are part of our country's journey to freedom, like the stories of my paternal grandparents.

My childhood was associated with the care of my paternal grandparents, which is contrary to my little sister who spent most of her time with maternal grandparents since she was a kid. During my primary school years, I lived with my paternal grandparents because my father was serving in the army and was often away from home. At the same time, my mother had just entered university to pursue a degree in education, hoping it would support her future career. This was also the period when I gathered the most memories and listened to countless stories they shared with me.

My grandpa was a veteran during the anti-French resistance. It seems like his background seemed to shape him into a very honest and straightforward person, sometimes a bit hot-tempered and had a high ego, but not violent at all. He almost did all the parent meetings during my primary school time and usually told fairy tales for me and my friend when they came to play. He was the one who helped me make a wooden sword for my silly childish games. I remember he kept all his stuff belonging to him in an old wardrobe, also where he kept my piggy bank. He had an old silver watch which was not functioning and wore it in formal events. At every meal, he would take his special spice, which was made from fish sauce and a lot of chillies. He might be angry with me about something in the afternoon, but seemed to immediately forget and treat me normally at dinner.

I’ve heard many stories about his time in the army, some from him and others from my parents and relatives. My grandma, on the other hand, rarely talked about those times One time she even grumbled when grandpa tried to do so with me. 

My grandpa wasn’t originally from the same province where his children were later born. He came from a nearby region that had seen some of the fiercest fighting during the war against the U.S. He grew up in a landowning family but lied about his age so he could join the army early. One story he shared stayed with me. He told me about a battle where he was lucky to survive. He was shot in the leg, while many of his squadmates were killed by bullets to more vital areas. The first thing he did after being shot was to bury his gun in the sand so the enemy wouldn’t find it. After that, he was captured and sent to a French hospital for treatment. There, by chance, he met an old friend who was working as a doctor on the French side. They had a brief conversation. Grandpa asked him why he was working there, and the friend simply replied, “Just for bread and butter.” 

The war created strange intersections like that. My grandma, who later became his wife, was also shaped by that era.
