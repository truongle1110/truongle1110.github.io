Today marks 50 years since the North and South of Vietnam were reunited. After enduring a series of wars against France, Japan, the United States, and China, Vietnam achieved full independence and national unity on April 30, 1975. This momentous day holds immense historical significance for the Vietnamese people and reminds us not just of historical events, but of countless personal stories woven into the fabric of our nation's freedom, stories like those of my paternal grandparents.

My childhood was associated with the care of my paternal grandparents, which is contrary to my little sister who spent most of her time with maternal grandparents since she was a kid. During my primary school years, I lived with my paternal grandparents because my father was serving in the army and was often away from home. At the same time, my mother had just entered university to pursue a degree in education, hoping it would support her future career. This was also the period when I gathered the most memories and listened to countless stories they shared with me.

My grandfather was a soldier during the anti-French resistance. It seems like his background seemed to shape him into a very honest and straightforward person, sometimes a bit hot-tempered, but not violent. He almost did all the parent meetings during my primary school time and usually told fairy tales for me and my friend when they came to play. He was the one who helped me make a wooden sword for my silly childish games. I remember he kept all his stuff belonging to him in an old wardrobe, also where he kept my piggy bank. He had an old silver watch which was not functioning and wore it in formal events. Every meal, he would take his special spice, which make from fish sauce and a lot of chillies. He might be angry with me about something in the afternoon, but seemed to immediately forget and treat me normally at dinner.
