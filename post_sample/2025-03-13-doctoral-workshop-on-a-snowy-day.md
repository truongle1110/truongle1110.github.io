In mid-March, my Doctoral school, IAEM (Informatique, Automatique, Electronique-Electrotechnique, Math√©matiques), organized a "Review" day for doctoral students starting their second year. The main goals were to create an opportunity for Doctorants, who have started their thesis for more than one year, to present their work so far, and also connect people in relevant fields. As part of the event, they were asked to present a poster summarizing the research topic, initial results, and the outlook. In addition, a short presentation on the research topic was also required. I, of course, was not an exception.

## The workshop
Honestly, I felt quite uninterested before the event, mostly because the project I was working on had too many things to do and those are the things I don't really like from partners' requirements. I even forgot the da of the poster submission deadline and only had one day to finish and send it to doctoral school.
