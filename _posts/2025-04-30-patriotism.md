Today marks 50 years since the North and South of Vietnam were reunited. After enduring a series of wars against France, Japan, the United States, and China, Vietnam achieved full independence and national unity on April 30, 1975. This momentous day holds immense historical significance for the Vietnamese people and reminds us not just of historical events, but of countless personal stories woven into the fabric of our nation's freedom, stories like those of my paternal grandparents.

My childhood was associated with the care of my paternal grandparents, which is contrary to my little sister who spent most of her time with maternal grandparents since she was a kid. During my primary school years, I lived with my paternal grandparents because my father was serving in the army and was often away from home. At the same time, my mother had just entered university to pursue a degree in education, hoping it would support her future career. This was also the period when I gathered the most memories and listened to countless stories they shared with me.

My grandfather was a soldier during the anti-French resistance.
