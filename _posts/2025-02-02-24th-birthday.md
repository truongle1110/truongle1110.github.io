I am very grateful to you, my friends in CRAN lab, for organizing a warm and surprise birthday party for me, the youngest and most immature PhD student in our lab.

After spending more than a year in France, I’ve had the opportunity to learn many things from you—about the culture, way of thinking, research work, and more.
