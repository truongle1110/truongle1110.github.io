In mid-March, my Doctoral school, IAEM (Informatique, Automatique, Electronique-Electrotechnique, Mathématiques), organized a "Review" day for doctoral students starting their second year. The main goals were to create an opportunity for Doctorants, who have started their thesis for more than one year, to present their work so far, and also connect people in relevant fields. As part of the event, they were asked to present a poster summarizing the research topic, initial results, and the outlook. In addition, a short presentation on the research topic was also required. I, of course, was not an exception.

Honestly, I felt quite uninterested before the event, mostly because the project I was working on had too many things to do and those were the things I didn't really like from partners' requirements. I even forgot the day of the poster submission deadline and only had one day to finish and send it to doctoral school. Anyway, order from École Doctorale, can't get away from that.

## The workshop
Most of the research topics came from people of my lab, CRAN, and focused on Control Theory, which is one of the fields I really enjoyed during undergrad and planned to pursue this direction if it was not for the PhD position here. A lot of interesting topics appeared in the list, including: System identification for aircrafts, observer for autonomous vehicles and RL-based control. Shamefully, I’ve almost forgotten everything I once knew in this field. The only thing right then I could ask those students who were working in Control was about the project they were working on and how they could apply their thesis in real-world scenarios.

However, it turned out not to be completely meaningless to come there. Safety RL-based control was the most interesting work to me, maybe partly because it was related to my topic, at least about the RL aspect. In addition, traditional RL learns by <em>trial and error</em>, that’s fine in games or simulations, but in the real world, trial and error could be dangerous, for examples:
> - Industrial machines operate in environments where unsafe maintenance actions can cause damage.
> - In autonomous driving, a poor decision could cause a crash.
> - A robotic manipulator that learns to pick fragile items may apply too much force and break them.
