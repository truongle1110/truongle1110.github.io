Today is January 16, 2025, the same day I wrote this first blog. Actually, I created this webpage more than 2 weeks ago, when it was a holiday in almost all Western countries (I guess). Honestly, in the beginning, I made this page just to consider it like an online portfolio, which (I think) will help me to get recognition from some recruiters or professors in the future when I finish my PhD.

Blogs are not something very unfamiliar to me, I read them quite often on [spiderum](https://spiderum.com/) and some of my Viet friends' living the city where I am studying. I particularly like the blog of a bro, who also did the PhD and Postdoc in Chemistry. This bro wrote in Vietnamese and it seems like he knows where his position in life is (I don't know how to describe this, do I?). To me, it's good to know people's perspectives, whether I agree with them or not, to build my own perspective system (I think).

Talking about me, I'm terrible at writing (except for scientific stuff, I guess). This was proven by my marks in literature at secondary/high school. For me, Vietnamese can sometimes feel unnecessarily complex in learning contexts, perhaps because my vocabulary is limited, or maybe because my soul feels too dry.
