Today is January 16, 2024, the same day I wrote this first blog. Actually, I created this webpage more than 2 weeks ago, when it was a holiday in almost all Western countries (I guessed). Honestly, in the beginning, I made this page just to consider it like an online portfolio, which (I think) will help me to get recognition from some recruiters or professors in the future when I finish the PhD.
