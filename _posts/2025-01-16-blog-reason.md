Today is January 16, 2025, the same day I wrote this first blog post. Actually, I created this webpage more than 2 weeks ago, when it was a holiday in almost all Western countries (I guess). Honestly, in the beginning, I made this page just to consider it like an online portfolio, something I hope might help me to get recognition from some recruiters or professors in the future when I finish my PhD.

Blogs are not something very unfamiliar to me, I read them quite often on [spiderum](https://spiderum.com/) and  from some Vietnamese friends living in the same city where I’m studying. Among them, I particularly enjoy the blog of a bro who pursued a PhD and Postdoc in Chemistry. This guy writes in Vietnamese and it seems like he knows where he stands in life (though I struggle to describe this feeling accurately). To me, it's valuable to learn about different people's perspectives, whether I agree with them or not, to build my own worldview (I think).

Talking about me, I'm terrible at writing (except for scientific stuff, I guess). This was proven by my marks in literature during secondary and high school. Sometimes, I find Vietnamese unnecessarily complicated in learning contexts, perhaps because my vocabulary is limited, or maybe because my soul feels too dry?

Anyway, as a PhD student, writing is a must. In addtion, I want to develop myself, acquire valuable skills during this time to get a good job after graduation and make my youth worthy by doing something meaningful. Writing my personal thought seems like a good way to start.

For these reasons, I’m starting this first blog post and serious about writing regularly (maybe once a week). After submitting the draft for a journal article to my profs,  I finally have a bit of time to blog and prepare for my trip back to Vietnam for Tet. So maybe during this time, I will write something more than usual.

I want to write both in English and Vietnamese, I personally like the playful, childish (trẻ trâu), sometimes a bit vulgar contents from some Vietnamese meme facebook pages. I don't mind if people see me as immature for sharing this. After all, not every PhD student has to be serious all the time.

Thank you for anyone visiting my blog, you may come across some of my one-sided, impolite or ironic point of view. If that happens, you can send me any anonymous messages to say whatever you want through this [link](https://ngl.link/drenykstein2).
