This is a hangout organized by some of my labmates for Rafael, who is my labmate, officemate as well as flatmate. He is a visiting student from Brazil, his supervisor sent him to France to work with my prof here because they're research collaborators (and good friends - at least in the academic sense).

We started the shooting night at 8 pm at [Cosmic Park](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Cosmic+Park+54/@48.684242,6.2003571,15.94z/data=!4m14!1m7!3m6!1s0x479499787e26db93:0xc362fa5fa4c7833b!2sCosmic+Park+54!8m2!3d48.6848449!4d6.2041101!16s%2Fg%2F11hms47jd1!3m5!1s0x479499787e26db93:0xc362fa5fa4c7833b!8m2!3d48.6848449!4d6.2041101!16s%2Fg%2F11hms47jd1?entry=ttu&g_ep=EgoyMDI1MDMxMS4wIKXMDSoASAFQAw%3D%3D). Besides lazer, this place also includes a large section for trampoline jumping, karaoke and especially the game called "Prison Island", which I missed in the doctoral school gathering because of a project meeting. Talking about the lazer game, it costs 7 euros for each person for 1 round (about 20 minutes). We decided to play 2 rounds and switch teams after each.

The 2 teams:

Before playing, I was perhaps so confident that I would be one of the top players due to my shooting skill in the military course from undergrad and honed through PUBG Mobile. Sadly, it's not. 

My name is Metamorph, it's super cool by the way.

In the last working day, he gave me a T-shirt of the Brazil football team, due to the fact that I gave him a T-shirt of the Vietnam football team when I returned from home, a symbol of our time together and culture exchange.
