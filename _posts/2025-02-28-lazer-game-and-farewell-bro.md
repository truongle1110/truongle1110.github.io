This is an hangout organized by some of my labmates for Rafael, who is my labmate, officemate as well as flatmate. He is a visiting student from Brazil, his supervisor sent him to France to work with my supervisor here because they're good friends (at least in term of research).

We started the shooting night at 8 p.m at [Cosmic Park](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Cosmic+Park+54/@48.684242,6.2003571,15.94z/data=!4m14!1m7!3m6!1s0x479499787e26db93:0xc362fa5fa4c7833b!2sCosmic+Park+54!8m2!3d48.6848449!4d6.2041101!16s%2Fg%2F11hms47jd1!3m5!1s0x479499787e26db93:0xc362fa5fa4c7833b!8m2!3d48.6848449!4d6.2041101!16s%2Fg%2F11hms47jd1?entry=ttu&g_ep=EgoyMDI1MDMxMS4wIKXMDSoASAFQAw%3D%3D). Beside lazer, this place also includes a large section for trampoline jumping, karaoke and especially the game called "Prison Island", which I missed in the doctoral school gathering due to project meeting. Talking about the lazer game, it costs 7 euros for each person for 1 round (about 20 minutes). We decided to play 2 rounds and switch team after each.
The 2 teams:

Before playing, I was confident that I will be one of the top players due to my shooting skill in the military course from undergrad and honed through PUBG Mobile. Futhermore, my name is Metamorph, it's super cool by the way.
