Flashback to 31 October 2023, when I had my first halloween celebration with some friends.

We first gathered at a bubble tea shop owned by a Vietnamese bro, and this was the view of the street we experienced at night.

We then went to a Thai restaurant, which was also my first time trying Thai food.

After the restaurant, we went for a drink and played billiards. I didn't take those pictures unfortunately.

Later, we decided to head to a bar for more drinks and dancing. Finding a bar after 10 PM was challenging, but we were lucky to come across one. Personally, Iâ€™m not a fan of noisy places, but I did want to experience the bar atmosphere for the first time. We went there, kept drinking and dancing except for me, I helped them watch over their bags, saw them enjoy the moment while scrolling my phone screen.

It was truly a nice experience, thanks all my bros.
