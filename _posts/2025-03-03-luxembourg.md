After the raining WTF (Wednesday Thursday Friday), luckily the sun roses at weekend. I and some friends had a trip to Luxembourg, just an unplanned trip on Sunday. The reasons are simply to get out of the boring scenery of Nancy and marked a new destination on my New Year's wish list. 

Honestly, the comments about Luxembourg I heard from my Vietnamese friends were not really impressive. In fact, I went to Luxembourg before with one Vietnamese guy. He just wanted to go some convenience stores near the border for purchasing cigarettes and gas due to the fact that they cost more in France and it's not too far from my city to go there. So this time, I had a proper chance to go to the city center and explore some typical places.

The fastest way to go to Luxembourg is by SNCF Train, it took us about 1,5 hours. Although the bus is much more cheaper and maybe just 30 minutes later than train, we could not find any in the morning except for the one at 11 am. 

We arrived at about 9.30 am, went down the street, visited Adolphe bridge, Ville Haute and [Nationalmusée um Fëschmaart](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Nationalmus%C3%A9e+um+F%C3%ABschmaart/@49.6116589,6.1321055,17.53z/data=!4m6!3m5!1s0x4795494f798428ad:0xe3b9606b16e95d1f!8m2!3d49.6116419!4d6.1338587!16s%2Fm%2F027fkzk?entry=ttu&g_ep=EgoyMDI1MDMxMi4wIKXMDSoASAFQAw%3D%3D), then had lunch together and went home.
